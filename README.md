## Development troubleshooting

### Environment variables

- For IaC related environment variables:
  - used in the client side of the Next app, you need to use the environment parameter in the IaC to pass the variable in, and then use 'raw' `process.env` to access.
  - used server side only you can use sst ion linking with `import { Resource } from "sst";` to access the environment variables.
- For other environment variables, use file at ./src/env.mjs.
